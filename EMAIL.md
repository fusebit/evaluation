Hi -

Thanks for the time you've spent with me so far. I've enjoyed our conversations to date! Now that you have a better idea what Fusebit is building, I'd like to learn a little more about your technical and communication skills.

I've set up a Github repository at https://github.com/fusebit/evaluation which contains a little scenario/project to help drive this discovery. This is not a real project, but it does have an interesting pull request that's been created on it by a junior engineer that you've been mentoring.

There are instructions in the README to follow, but succinctly, I'd like you to create a document - a Google Doc or equivalent - that contains your review of the requested PR. Think about this like you would a GitHub pull request - line number and the comment that you would place at that line would be entirely sufficient.

Hereâ€™s an example comment:

```
Line 1:
Use import instead of require.
```

The project will be evaluated on two different criteria - first, we are looking to learn more about your professional communication style: how do you communicate about critical challenges in code in a clear, constructive, and actionable fashion. Second, we're looking to see how well you're able to identify technical issues. Think of it like a treasure hunt!

There's no particular time limit on this exercise, but try to complete it within two days if possible, just to keep the process moving smoothly. Our expectation is that this project will take no more than an hour or two.

Send your review as a PDF via email to review@fusebit.io. I'll acknowledge receipt within a day or two, and will review it after that.

If you have any questions, ambiguities to resolve, or are unable to access the repository, please don't hesitate to ask me questions!

Looking forward to your review!

Cheers, 
Benn Bollay
