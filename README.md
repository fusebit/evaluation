# Scenario

You are a principal engineer at I Eatz Sushi, the more upscale version of a historically relevant internet
property.  IES shows people funny pictures of cats dressed up like sushi.  Or maybe it's sushi that looks like
cats.  You've never been quite sure which one it is.  Popularity has steadily been increasing, and the team
has been growing to support the larger workload, including a few less experienced engineers that look to you
for mentorship and technical leadership.

You're about to go on vacation for a week in Bermuda and one of the junior engineers that you mentor has just
completed adding user authorization.  They've published a PR, with a description of the feature and it's
requirements, and are looking forward to your feedback.

You really want them to do a good job, so you're going to give them a _really_ detailed review so that by the
time you get back the code is in good shape.

# Task

This repository contains a sample PR for you to review.  Please create your PR feedback in an document
suitable for this junior engineer, and mail that document to `review@fusebit.io`.  You're welcome to follow
existing PR guidelines, cite code snippets (quoting line numbers is generally sufficient), and refer to
specific lines as you evaluate for syntax errors, inefficiencies, functional gaps, or non-idiomatic code.

If you need clarification or any additional context, please don't hesitate to email `review@fusebit.io` and
ask questions!

_Note:_ This repository is not a fully functional project.  Please pretend that the pull request is adding a
feature to a much larger, fully functioning web application.
